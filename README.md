Vercel - to deploy the site
Contentful - to store and deliver the content
C. Lab instructions

npx create-next-app@latest
Answer Yes to TypeScript and ESLint
Inspect the codebase and try to understand how it's setup.

Create your own GitHub repo and push this code to it.

Create a Contentful account.
